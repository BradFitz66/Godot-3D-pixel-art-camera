# Godot 3D pixel camera

A showcase of a camera for 3D pixel art game. This (hopefully) ensures that there is minimal/no pixel creep/swimming when moving the camera.

This is made possible by code provided by denovodavid on reddit:

# ToDo:

* Make work for all resolutions. Currently it seems to only work for 640x360, I tried half that (320x180) and had a bunch of pixel swimming issues.
* Add a camera-following-player example instead of a free camera.
